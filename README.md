# Atom Material UI

A dark UI theme for Atom that (kinda) follows Google's Material Design Guidelines. Best with [Atom Material Syntax](https://github.com/silvestreh/atom-material-syntax). Inspired by Mattia Astorino's [SublimeText theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme).

## Configuration

Atom Material UI supports different accent colors. To change it, go to Settings > Themes and click the cog icon next to the theme selector.

You'll find the color dropdown there.
